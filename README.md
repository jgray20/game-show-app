 A browser-based word guessing game

This is an interactive game where the user guesses a secret phrase. Initially, the user is given blank spaces for all of the letters in the phrase, and is given 5 chances to guess all of the correct letters. If the user incorrectly guesses 5 times, the game ends as a loss. If the user correctly solves the phrase, the game ends with a win. The user is able to restart and play the game as many times as desired. Phrase and Game classes were created with various supporting methods to promote interactivity, such as generating a new random phrase at the beginning of each game, keeping track of the number of incorrect guesses, and providing a custom response to whether or not the user won or lost that round of play.
